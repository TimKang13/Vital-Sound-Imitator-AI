# Vital-Sound-Imitator-AI
AI that will hear a synthesizer sound and recreate it with vital synth

How do I get a trainable amount of sound matched with its parameters??
Do I automate? 
  -Research into how synth generate sound.   
  -look at how parameters are passed into the synth as what datatypes
  -look to automate the process and save input and output as a pair of files 
Look at .vital files

Probably easier than expected, will just have to process .vital files 
  -use free give presets first
 -do need way more
  

FEATURES: 
Properties of a sound  (further research)

LABELS:   list of these values?
OSC 1 
0. Mix  (0,1)
1. Wave Shape  (output as what? polynomial function??)
2. Unison Amount  (1,16)
3. Unison %      (0,100)
4. Phase angle   (0,360)
5. Phase %       (0,100)
6. Filter/Effect  
OSC2  same
OSC3  ame 
SMP 
0. Mix  (0,1)
1. Noise Type
2. Sample Transpose  (-48,48)
3. Sample Tune (-100, 100)
4. Level       (0,1) 
5. Pan%         (-100,100)
6. Filter/Effect 

Wait I should just get the data from vital itself... stop calculating.
